title: What is a SHMUP game?
content: >
  SHMUP stands for "Shoot 'em up" a video game genre characterized by a side or
  overhead view of a ship (or other character) weaving through waves of incoming
  fire while blasting down enemy ships. It's a genre forged in the fires of 80s
  and 90s quarter slurping arcade machines, where you were expected to lose over
  and over again to get better at memorizing how to optimally move through the
  stages.&#x20;


  Games like Gradius and Space Invaders kicked off the genre in the early years,
  followed up by classics like Gradius and R-Type in the late 80s, and evolving
  into the bullet-hell (SHMUP games characterized by massive amounts of enemy
  fire to dodge) Cave games like DoDonPachi of the 90s.


  It's a small genre these days, far from the days where it ruled the arcades.
  But one cool thing about SHMUPs is they don't require a massive amount of
  text, video, 3d models or other expensive assets to get working. Today many
  solidly selling indie SHMUP games are created by a single developer or a very
  small team. So they make a great first genre to start with when learning how
  to code with a new game engine.
