title: Viewing HTML in VS Code for Education
content: >
  This course assume that you have a bit of basic knowledge about HTML and
  Javascript. Some concepts will be explained in the course, but it might be
  tricky to follow along with if totally new to this. If you want to get a bit
  of basic knowledge here, VS Code for Education's [Intro to Web
  Development](https://vscodeedu.com/courses/intro-to-web-dev) course is a great
  place to start out!


  ### Previewing HTML
