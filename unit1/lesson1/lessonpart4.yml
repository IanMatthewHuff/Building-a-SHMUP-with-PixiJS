title: JavaScript in VS Code for Education
content: >+
  HTML provides the static layout for your webpage, but to actually make things
  happen you need JavaScript running behind the scenes. For our PixiJS coding
  the HTML is just going to be a very minimal layout to host PixiJS and
  basically all the work is going to be happening in JavaScript (JS) files.Â 


  When working with JS file in VS Code for Education, the files will show up to
  the right of the course content. As you make JS changes the HTML Preview
  window will automatically update with your changes if open.


  With the HTML Preview window open try uncommenting (removing the "//") in the
  code file. Then when you click the button it should start counting up by two.


  > \[!NOTE]

  > You can't run a JS file directly, so to launch the HTML Preview, you need to
  do so from an HTML file
