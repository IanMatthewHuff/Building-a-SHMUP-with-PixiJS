title: Handling resizing
content: >
  Our PixiJS canvas is on screen, but it looks a little...small? And what will
  happen when the browser size of our screen changes? Let's handle this by
  adding code to our script for resizing the game canvas.


  > \[!NOTE]

  > We're going to be resizing the game display canvas here, not the actual size
  of the internal game engine. The game engine will continue to run at our
  smaller retro game resolution, but we're going to scale up the final output
  resolution while maintaining the aspect ratio to avoid stretching. An
  important distinction to remember as our positioning calculations for object
  will all be in the game engine resolution.


  ### Handling resizes


  Inside our `initGame` function we're going to add a new function to handle
  resizing. You don't need to worry about all the math here if you don't want,
  but suffice to say it's going to look to take as much vertical space as the
  window gives it, while maintaining our 3/4 display ratio. This code needs to
  be added inside and add the end of the initGame code.


  ```javascript
     function resizeCanvas() {
          const windowWidth = window.innerWidth;
          const windowHeight = window.innerHeight;
          const windowRatio = windowWidth / windowHeight;
          
          let newWidth, newHeight;
          
          if (windowRatio > ASPECT_RATIO) {
              newHeight = windowHeight;
              newWidth = newHeight * ASPECT_RATIO;
          } else {
              newWidth = windowWidth;
              newHeight = newWidth / ASPECT_RATIO;
          }
          
          app.canvas.style.width = newWidth + 'px';
          app.canvas.style.height = newHeight + 'px';
      }
  ```


  ### Triggering the resize


  This function handles resizing, but when do we actually run this function to
  do the resize? The answer is wonderfully simple. We just run it once to pick
  up the initial sizing, then we run it whenever we detect the web browser
  resizes. One of the very helpful things about running our game in a browser.
  To do this, we'll hook up our function to run when the [resize
  event](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/resize_event)
  on the window is triggered. Below our `resizeCanvas` function, but still
  inside `initGame` just add this code.


  ```javascript
      resizeCanvas();
      window.addEventListener('resize', resizeCanvas);
  ```
