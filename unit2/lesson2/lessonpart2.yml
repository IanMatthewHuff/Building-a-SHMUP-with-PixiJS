  SHMUPs

  * Reddit's [r/shmups](reddit.com/r/shmups) channel is a good place to learn about interesting new games and revisit past classic in the genre.
  * [System11 forums](https://shmups.system11.org/) are focused just on SHMUP games, and they have a wealth of information in particular for deep fans of the genre. They have a section of their forums dedicated in particular to the [development](https://shmups.system11.org/viewforum.php?f=9&sid=cf6d94e29bc6eba576de5b50ae85087e) of SHMUP games.
  * The [SHMUPs wiki](https://shmups.wiki/library/Main_Page) is a great place to browse around for organized and detailed information, in particular about classic SHMUPs. If you ever wanted to know way, way too much about Battle Garegga's [esoteric rank system](https://shmups.wiki/library/Main_Page), this is the place to go.
