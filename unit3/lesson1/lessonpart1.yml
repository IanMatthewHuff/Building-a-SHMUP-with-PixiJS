title: Game update loops
content: >
  Sure we have a ship on the screen, but with nothing moving, it's not a very
  exciting game.


  ### Game update loops


  Many applications and websites run in a way that the users hits a key or
  presses a button, then the UI updates, then it goes back to waiting for the
  next user input. But this doesn't work for something like a video game. Video
  games need to be updating all the time, enemies are moving, sprites are
  animating, scores are updating. So video game all run on a game update loop,
  where the game state is continually changing, and the graphics are continually
  redrawn on screen. When you hear about games running at 60 FPS (Frames Per
  Second) they are referring to how fast the game update loop is running. The
  faster the game update loop is running the more responsive the game feels and
  the smoother the animations look, 60 FPS is considered a bit of gold standard
  for games, while dropping under 30 FPS can start to feel laggy and jittery.
