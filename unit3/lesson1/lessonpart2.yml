title: PixiJS update loop
content: >
  Now that we learned what a game update loop is, we need to apply that
  knowledge to PixiJS in particular.


  ### Ticker


  For PixiJS timing the
  [Ticker](https://pixijs.download/release/docs/ticker.Ticker.html) class is
  what we use for controlling game update timing. If you look at the
  documentation more there is lot of flexibility with controlling multiple
  different tickers for various animation and game update functions. But for now
  we can stick with just using the ticker built into the game App that we
  already created.


  Lets add an update function to the main Ticker of our game:


  ```javascript
      // Hook up our update function
      function update() {
      }
      app.ticker.add(update);
  ```


  Seems like nothing happened with that change? That's because we've hooked up
  an update function that's not changing anything. To have something actually
  happen here, go ahead and add a line like this to the update function body.


  ```javascript

  ship.rotation += .1;

  ```


  Now you should see the ship start to rotate in the preview
