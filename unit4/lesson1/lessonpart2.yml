title: ðŸŒŠ Enemy waves
content: >+
  One enemy sitting right in front of your ship does not make for a very tense
  SHMUP game. What we want is for there to be lots of incoming enemies, moving
  down at the player. So our next step is to spawn waves of enemies from the top
  of the screen and move them down toward the player. The spawn enemy function
  that we've already made will be helpful for spawning more enemies on screen.
