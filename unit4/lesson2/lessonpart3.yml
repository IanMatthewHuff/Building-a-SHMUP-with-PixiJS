title: The final score
content: >+
  There are a number of next steps that we could take to expand and improve on
  this project that are detailed in the section below.

  it is to share your create with friends!


  But for one final thing, let's actually show that score that we were keeping
  track of on screen so you can see how well you are doing. We can add in a
  PixiJS [Text](https://pixijs.download/release/docs/scene.Text.html) object
  that, like a Sprite, can be added to the scene and updated. Add this code in
  after where the sprites were initialized.


  ```javascript
      // Create score text
      const scoreText = new PIXI.Text({
          text: 'Score: 0',
          style: {
              fontFamily: 'Arial',
              fontSize: 18,
              fill: 0xffffff,
              fontWeight: 'bold'
          }
      });
      scoreText.x = 10;
      scoreText.y = 10;
      app.stage.addChild(scoreText);
  ```


  Below that, we can create a small helper function to update the score and call
  it once to initialize it.


  ```javascript
      // Function to update the score display
      function updateScoreDisplay() {
          scoreText.text = `Score: ${score}`;
      }

      // Initialize score display
      updateScoreDisplay();
  ```
